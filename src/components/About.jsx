                    I embarked my journey as a B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering student at Ramkrishna Mahato Government Engineering College in 2020. Along the way, I fearlessly explored various fields, including Graphic Designing, Content Creation, Freelancing, and Entrepreneurship. I delved into the world of cutting-edge technologies, such as Python, Cloud computing, React, Flutter, and Firebase. I also took my passion for technology and leadership to new heights by co-establishing Google Developer Student Clubs and the E-Cell in my college, alongside my equally enthusiastic classmates. At present, I serve GDSC RKMGEC as the Co-Lead and holds the significant responsibility of being the In-Charge of E-Cell RKMGEC.

                    In a constant pursuit of sharing knowledge and fostering growth, I've organized numerous technical workshops, imparting valuable insights on technologies like Python, Android, and Google Cloud to aspiring learners. With a commitment to personal development and a drive for making a positive impact within the tech community.

                    I've worked for many projects for my clients as well as my personal projects. I also contributed for the GDSC RKMGEC web page. I have a Instagram page (@codewithbiki) where I create content for those who are just starting with programming and have more that 70k followers. I have learning attitude and growth mindset which helps me to collaborate with people and work for the society.
